# TwitterCleaner
Utilizes Twitter's API in order to scan through a user's tweets to look for unsatisfactory content

## Usage
In order to use this program you need to have developer access from Twitter. Once that is obtained, enter the various keys and tokens in the appropriate places within the program. `scan_generators.py` is a stand alone program while `scan_class.py` is meant to be utilized within another program. Both have the same functionality.
